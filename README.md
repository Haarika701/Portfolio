  <samp>I have recently finished an internship with the company Divercity. With a bachelor's degree in computer science and previous experience in semi-technical support, I collaborated with engineers to resolve customer issues. This exposure to software development piqued my interest in problem-solving, and I taught myself to build applications using Java. To further my skills and find a way into the software industry, I enrolled in a coding Bootcamp, where I honed my skills. I am excited to apply my skills and experiences to my next full-time position as a software engineer.

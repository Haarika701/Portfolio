            <p className="text-wrap px-5 py-3 w-50">I have a bachelor's degree in computer science and experience in semi-technical support. While working with engineers to solve customer issues, I gained insights into software development which sparked an interest in problem-solving. I taught myself how to use Java to build applications. Later I joined a coding Bootcamp to find a platform to get into the software industry. This Bootcamp helped me hone my software skills. I love collaborating with people with a keen interest in solving intellectual and interpersonal problems.

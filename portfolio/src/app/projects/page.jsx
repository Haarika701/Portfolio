This project was done with about 6-9 weeks of learning Javascript, React, Ruby with ActiveRecord and SQL. We had imagined our project to encapsulate an E-commerce single page application. We wanted to create this project to show our knowledge with SQL and creating our own frontend and backend functionality. The main focus of this project was to build our backend fully flushed out.</p>
